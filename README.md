# K-means application for image compression

In this application we used the K-means algorithm for compressing 
an image previously acquired by a smart camera.
For this implementation, we have chosen Python 3 as the programming language.

## Libraries needed

```bash
pip install sklearn.cluster
pip install skimage
pip install imageio
pip install pathlib
pip install numpy
pip install csv
```

## Run application
python kmeans.py
python ricostruzione.py
